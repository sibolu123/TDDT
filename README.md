# Traffic Light Dynamic Vehicle Detection and Timing

This project is a proof-of-concept for computer vision to replace induction coils' function for dynamic traffic light control. There has been papers using multiple cameras around the vicinity of the intersection to manage traffic flow, as well as products which uses specially placed cameras to detect presence of vehicles in pre-determined spots, but I wanted to use existing surveillance camera footage and computer vision to track the number of cars in each lane and their respective wait time.

The project is currently still in progress and has 2 versions so far. Version 1 simply tracks the most forward vehicle in each lane and calculates the red/green light time.
